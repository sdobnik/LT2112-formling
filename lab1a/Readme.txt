====== Writing feature structure grammars ======

Sentences in lines 1-10 are identical to those in sentences.txt. All other sentences are new. 

Lines 11-29 contain grammatical sentences. You should extend your existing grammar to parse these sentences. Of course, the same grammar should also parse all previous sentences in lines 1-10.

Lines 30-46 contain their ungrammatical variants that your grammar should not parse.

To run the parser simply replace your old sentences.txt with this version. You should also continue with the same grammar file. However, I would recommend to create a backup of the version that was working with the first version of sentences.txt.

Happy grammar writing!
